I have joined the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), where I will spend the summer working with [Victor Chardes](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/victor-chardes/) and [Surya Maddu](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/suryanarayana-maddu/), within [Michael Shelley](https://math.nyu.edu/~shelley/)'s team. I will be developing generative models to infer biophysical dynamics from omics data. See you in New York City!
