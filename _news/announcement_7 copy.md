Thrilled to announce two accepted papers at NeurIPS 2024: [GENOT: Entropic (Gromov) Wasserstein Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07829) and [Mirror and Preconditioned Gradient Descent in Wasserstein Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08938), with the latter receiving a spotlight! Huge thanks to my coauthors for these amazing collaborations. See you in Vancouver!
