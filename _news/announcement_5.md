I presented  [unbalanced Monge maps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.15100.pdf) at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/)'s reading group on generative models, transport and sampling, organized by [Valentin de Bortoli](https://vdeborto.github.io/) and [Arnaud doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/). Looking forward to presenting the paper at ICLR 2024!
