I teach tutorial classes to both undergraduate and graduate students at [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/) – [Insititut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/). Some graduate courses I am a teaching assistant for are part of the [Data Science MSc](https://www.ip-paris.fr/education/masters/mention-mathematiques-appliquees-statistique/master-year-2-data-science) at [École Poltechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/). By the end of my Ph.D., I will have taught a total of 192 hours of tutorial sessions. 

Below are the courses I am currently teching, or I taught, in reverse chronological order:
