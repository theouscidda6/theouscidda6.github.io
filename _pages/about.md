**Research:** My goal is to build powerful AI models capable of understanding, generating and reasoning with high-dimensional data across diverse modalities. I am currently focused on developing transferable techniques to improve generative models, including their training methodologies, architecture design, alignment, robustness, evaluation techniques and inference efficiency. I am also interested in generative modeling as a tool for scientific discovery. I invented many foundational concepts and techniques in (score-based) diffusion models, for which you can find more in a [blog post](/blog/2021/score/) and a [quanta magazine article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-physics-principle-that-inspired-modern-ai-art-20230105/).

**Previously:** I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), advised by [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon). I was a research intern at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/), Uber ATG, and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), where I worked with [Jun Zhu](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml), [Raquel Urtasun](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/), and [Richard Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/inquiry/home.php).

I am a PhD student working with [Marco Cuturi](https://marcocuturi.net/) ([Apple MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) & [CREST](https://crest.science/) - [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/), [IP-Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/)) on the interplay between optimal transport (OT), generative modeling and representational learning. Broadly speaking, I am commited to demonstrate how OT can be instrumental in various machine learning contexts. Recently, I have been interested in the application of OT in single-cell genomics and from February 2024, I will be visiting [Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/pi/fabian-theis) at [Helmholtz](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en) - [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) to explore these ideas further.  -->
