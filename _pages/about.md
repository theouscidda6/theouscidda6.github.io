**Education:** I am a Ph.D. student in machine learning working with [Marco Cuturi](https://marcocuturi.net/) ([Apple MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) & [CREST](https://crest.science/) - [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/)). Prior to that, I completed a master's degree in [mathematics, vision and learning](https://www.master-mva.com/) at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/), working with [Claire Boyer](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~cboyer/), [Julie Josse](https://juliejosse.com/) and [Boris Muzellec](https://borismuzellec.github.io/). Moreover, I hold a bachelor's degree form [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/), [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/).


**Research:** I work on the interplay between optimal transport (OT), generative modeling, and representational learning. Broadly speaking, I am committed to demonstrating how OT can be instrumental in various machine-learning contexts. Recently, I have developed a keen interest in applying OT to solve challenges arising in single-cell biology. Since February 2024, I have been visiting [Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/pi/fabian-theis) at the [Helmholtz](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en), [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) to further explore these ideas.
