**Education:** I am a Ph.D. student in machine learning working with [Marco Cuturi](https://marcocuturi.net/) ([Apple MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com/)). Prior to that, I completed a master's degree in [Mathematics, Vision and Learning](https://www.master-mva.com/) (MVA) at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/). During my master's thesis, I worked with [Claire Boyer](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~cboyer/) ([Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/)), [Julie Josse](https://juliejosse.com/) ([INRIA](https://inria.fr/fr)) and [Boris Muzellec](https://borismuzellec.github.io/) ([Owkin](https://www.owkin.com/)). 



**Research:** I work on the interplay between optimal transport (OT), generative modeling, and representational learning. Broadly speaking, I am committed to demonstrating how OT can be instrumental in various machine-learning contexts. Recently, I have developed a keen interest in applying OT to solve challenges arising in computational biology. Since February 2024, I have been visiting [Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/pi/fabian-theis) at [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en) to work on single-cell perturbation discovery. Additionally, I am spending the summer at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), where I work with [Victor Chardes](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/victor-chardes/) and [Surya Maddu](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/suryanarayana-maddu/), hosted in [Michael Shelley](https://math.nyu.edu/~shelley/)'s team, on developing generative models to infer biophysical dynamics from omics data.
