I am a PhD student working with [Marco Cuturi](https://marcocuturi.net/) ([Apple MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) & [CREST](https://crest.science/) - [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/), [IP-Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/)) on the interplay between optimal transport (OT), generative modeling and representational learning. Broadly speaking, I am commited to demonstrate how OT can be instrumental in various machine learning contexts. Recently, I have been interested in the application of OT in single-cell genomics and from February 2024, I will be visiting [Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/pi/fabian-theis) at [Helmholtz](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en) - [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) to explore these ideas further.
