**Education:** I am a Ph.D. student in machine learning working with [Marco Cuturi](https://marcocuturi.net/) ([Apple MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com/)). Prior to that, I completed a master's degree in [Mathematics, Vision and Learning](https://www.master-mva.com/) (MVA) at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/). During my master's thesis, I worked with [Claire Boyer](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~cboyer/) ([Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/)), [Julie Josse](https://juliejosse.com/) ([INRIA](https://inria.fr/fr)) and [Boris Muzellec](https://borismuzellec.github.io/) ([Owkin](https://www.owkin.com/)) at [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris/).

**Research:** I work on the interplay between optimal transport (OT), generative modeling, and representational learning. I intend to demonstrate how OT can introduce optimality structures within flow-, diffusion-, and VAE-based models, enhancing performance.
I have applied these methods across diverse areas, including [image generation/unpaired image translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.15100.pdf), 
[disentangled representation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07829), [optimization over probability spaces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08938), 
[geographic information](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11709), 
and various single-cell genomics challenges, such as [reconstructing cellular trajectories](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09254.pdf), 
[predicting cellular responses to perturbations](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/uscidda23a/uscidda23a.pdf), and 
[translating between different single-cell data modalities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09254.pdf). 
Recently, my focus has been on using OT to enhance/analyze the properties of vision/language foundation models. 
<!-- Broadly speaking, I thrive on exploring diverse learning paradigms, as I believe the most creative and impactful research ideas emerge from the synergies between different fields. -->

**Experiences:** Since February 2024, I have been a visting Ph.D. student in [Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/pi/fabian-theis)' lab at [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en), where I have been working on generative models for single-cell perturbation. Additionally, from June to August 2024, I interned at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/) in [Michael Shelley](https://math.nyu.edu/~shelley/)'s team to develop multi-marginal generative models for population dynamics. Since December 2024, I have been interning in the fundamental research team of [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) led by [Stefano Soatto](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lH1PdF8AAAAJ&hl=en/), where I work on large language models reasoning.
