I am a PhD student at [CREST](https://crest.science/)-[ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/), [IP-Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/), under the supervision of [Marco Cuturi](https://marcocuturi.net/) ([Apple MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) & [CREST](https://crest.science/)-[ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/)). I am working on the interplay between optimal transport, generative modeling and representational learning. Recently, I have been particularly interested in applying these concepts to single-cell genomics and from February 2024, I will be visiting [Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/pi/fabian-theis) at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/) to explore these ideas further.
