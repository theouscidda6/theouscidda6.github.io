I am a PhD student working with [Marco Cuturi](https://marcocuturi.net/) ([Apple MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) & [CREST](https://crest.science/)-[ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/), [IP-Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/)) on the interplay between optimal transport (OT), generative modeling and representational learning. Broadly speaking, I am eager to demonstrate how OT can be instrumental in addressing a variety of machine learning challenges arising in life-science. Recently, I have been particularly interested in the application of OT in single-cell genomics and from February 2024, I will be visiting [Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/pi/fabian-theis) at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/) to explore these ideas further.
