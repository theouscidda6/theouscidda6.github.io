**Education:** I am a Ph.D. student in machine learning working with [Marco Cuturi](https://marcocuturi.net/) ([Apple MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com/)). Prior to that, I completed a master's degree in [Mathematics, Vision and Learning](https://www.master-mva.com/) (MVA) at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/). During my master's thesis, I worked with [Claire Boyer](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~cboyer/) ([Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/)), [Julie Josse](https://juliejosse.com/) ([INRIA](https://inria.fr/fr)) and [Boris Muzellec](https://borismuzellec.github.io/) ([Owkin](https://www.owkin.com/)) at [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris/). 

**Research:** I study the interplay between optimal transport (OT) and machine learning. My primary goal is to demonstrate how OT can be used to introduce inductive biases in various learning contexts, particularly in generative modeling and representational learning. For instance, my work has been applied to [unpaired image translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.15100.pdf), [disentangled representation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07829), and various single-cell genomics problems like [trajectory inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08938), [perturbation effect prediction](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/uscidda23a/uscidda23a.pdf), and [modality translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09254.pdf). I am especially interested in these applications within the life sciences. This interest led me to join [Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/pi/fabian-theis)' lab at [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en) as a visting Ph.D. student in February 2024, where I am working on generative models to discover single-cell perturbations. Additionally, I interned at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/) from June to August 2024, collaborating with [Victor Chardes](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/victor-chardes/) and [Surya Maddu](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/suryanarayana-maddu/) in [Michael Shelley](https://math.nyu.edu/~shelley/)'s team to develop generative models for inferring biophysical dynamics from omics data. Currently, I am focused on using OT to enhance the training and/or performances of foundation models, particularly for tasks in computational biology and language modeling. During winter 2024, I will be interning at [Amazon AI](https://www.amazon.science/) with [Matthew Tragger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g3sXAWkAAAAJ&hl=en), within the fundamental research team led by [Alessandro Achille](https://alexachi.github.io/), where I will explore these ideas further.
